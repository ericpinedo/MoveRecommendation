-------------------------------------------------------------[  DESCRIPTION  ]-

The purpose of this project is to explore Data Science and Machine learning 
concepts and apply it to a movie recommendation system based on data.
The data set I used is from Movielens for a research initiative to exlpore some 
of the relationshipts between movie recommendation. My particular dataset 
is focused from movie's pre-2000's


-----------------------------------------------------------[ future updates]-


Is it possible to improve on these results? Perhaps a different method
or min_periods value on the correlation computation would produce more 
interesting results.

Perhaps movies similar to ones the user rated poorly should actually 
be penalized, instead of just scaled down?

There are also probably some outliers in the user rating data set - 
some users may have rated a huge amount of movies and have a disporportionate 
effect on the results. Next update should delete some outliers

Currently the system results are qualitative here, so next update 
should apply train/test and measure our ability to predict user 
ratings for movies they've already watched. Whether that's actually 
a measure of a "good" recommendation is debatable, though!
